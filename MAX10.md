# MAX10
MAX10 is a similar tech level to the Cyclone III, IV and 10LP, but has internal FLASH instead of requiring an external configuration device.

## Toolchain
MAX10 is supported by current versions of Quartus Prime.
Some MAX10 devices don't support initial RAM data within the configuration file.
Others do support this, but only if the configuration file type is set appropriately.
